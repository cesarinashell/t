## twitter for terminal

### what is this?
A terminal application that allows you to tweet and some other cool stuff with Twitter.
It uses the [brilliant library Tweepy] (https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) to perform all actions throught the Twitter REST API

You should install `tweepy` first using `pip install -r requeriments.txt`.

### Â¡work on progress!
This application is still being constructed, so it probably won't work as expected. Besides, is poorly documented because I'm still "playing around" with such cool stuff that Twitter API can offer.

### roadmap
- Implement basic twitter actions on code
- Make a real terminal thing; consistent and modularized code

As the project goes on, this will modified and more things will be added.

Feel free to interact, you are more than welcome :)
